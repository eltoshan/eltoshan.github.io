I'm an actuary by training, but I've always been a hacker at heart.  Given the rise in the volume and availability of data in recent years, it only made sense to combine the mathematical & statistical knowledge with programming.  I'm keeping this blog partly as future reference for myself on the various tools and algorithms I will be using in my data science endeavors.  

### More Information

I'm going to list some of my favorite reference texts.  I hope they will be useful to you as well!

*  [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
*  [Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/)
*  [Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)

### Rock Climbing

This is the other passion of my life, so there will occassionally be posts about my rock climbing escapades on here as well.
